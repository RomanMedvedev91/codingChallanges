/*

given a string of only integer characters str, separate the string into subsets such that each subset has the same single-digit total sum. Use an underscore _ to separate subsets in the input string. Return all such subset creations in a result arrav, and then sort that arrav lexicographically betore returning it.
Description
Input: string str
Output: string result

Examples and Explanations

Thout: 11741380
Output: ["17 413_80", "174 1380",
1741380"7

Exolanation: The last element in the result arrav 1741380" is just the input string itself. This is considered to be one of the subsets as the whole input Is a subset of itselt. Additionally. as this is the only subset. the sum of its single digits is 1+7+4+1+3+8+0, which is 24. With no other subset to compare to, this means that every subset (just the one has the same single anglt sum. As for the other two:
+6 =>
1+7รท4 => 12
1+3+8+0 => 12
Tonut: 111111
Output: ["1_1_1_1", "11_11", "1111"]

Explanation: The last element "1111" is the only subset, and its total of 4 is the total across all (one) subsets. As for the first two elements in the result
array, each subset has the same single-digit total:
1+1 => 2
1+1 => 2
Input: 198723"
Outnut: T119872347
Explanation: The only subset of 198723" that has the same single-digit total across all of its subsets is the initial inout itself.
